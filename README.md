# Perception-Track.ai
AI-powered perception system using YOLOv8 for real-time pose and vehicle detection. Detects lying-down poses with timed alerts via Email &amp; Telegram, and tracks vehicles and humans with color, type, and face recognition. Designed for safety monitoring and intelligent surveillance.

Maybe the file may seem a bit to long but if u Read every line and understand then it will be way easier to work with.
Try to do some changes and with improvisation of exsiting code.

Overview:
Two AI-powered detection systems using YOLOv8:

1. Pose Detection - Detects lying down poses and sends alerts via Email and Telegram after 10s, 25s, 40s.
2. Vehicle and Human Recognition - Tracks vehicles (with color/type) and recognizes faces.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python
Download and install [Python 3.10.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3103/)  
‚úîÔ∏è *Check ‚ÄúAdd to PATH‚Äù during installation*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone Repository & Setup Virtual Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perception-track-ai.git
cd perception-track-ai

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Folder Structure
```
perception-track-ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pose with Notification Alert.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vehical and human pipeline.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                    # YOLO models (auto-downloaded)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset/                   # Place your videos here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ face_encodings/            # Face recognition data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pose_analysis_output/      # Pose detection results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ up_optimized_m/            # Vehicle/human output data
```

Create directories manually if missing:
```bash
mkdir -p models dataset face_encodings pose_analysis_output/alerts
mkdir -p up_optimized_m/{vehicles,persons,best_faces}
```

## ü§ñ Configuration Steps

### üì® Telegram Bot Setup (Pose Detection Alerts)
1. Open Telegram and start chat with **@BotFather**
2. Run `/newbot` ‚Üí follow prompts ‚Üí copy **Bot Token**
3. Get **Chat ID**:
   - Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Send message to bot, refresh to find `"chat":{"id":...}`

In code:
```python
BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token_here"
CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id_here"
```

### üìß Gmail Setup (Email Alerts)
1. Enable **2-Step Verification** in Google Account  
2. Go to **App Passwords** ‚Üí Generate 16-character password  
3. Replace credentials in code:
```python
SENDER_ACCOUNTS = [{
    "email": "your_email@gmail.com",
    "password": "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
}]
RECEIVER_EMAILS = ["recipient@gmail.com"]
```

### üé• Video Path Setup
```python
VIDEO_PATH = r"D:\path\to\your\video.mp4"
```

### üß¨ Optional: Face Recognition Encoding
If none exist, create empty encoding file:
```python
import pickle, numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

data = {"encodings": np.array([]), "names": [], "pca": PCA(n_components=50)}
with open("face_encodings/face_encodings_pca.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Modules

### üßç Pose Detection System
```bash
python "Pose with Notification Alert.py"
```
**Functions:**
- Real-time pose classification: Standing / Sitting / Lying  
- Triggers alerts after 10s, 25s, and 40s of lying down  
- Alerts via **Email & Telegram**  
- Press `q` to exit or `p` to pause

**Outputs:**
- CSV: `pose_analysis_output/pose_analysis.csv`  
- Alerts: `pose_analysis_output/alerts/`

---

### üöó Vehicle & Human Detection
```bash
python "Vehical and human pipeline.py"
```
**Functions:**
- Tracks vehicles by type (car, bus, truck, motorcycle)  
- Detects vehicle color  
- Tracks humans with unique IDs  
- Saves best-quality frames and logs

**Outputs:**
- Vehicles: `up_optimized_m/vehicles/`  
- Persons: `up_optimized_m/persons/`  
- Logs: `up_optimized_m/*.csv`

## üß© Detection Logic Summary

| Pose | Condition |
|------|------------|
| Standing | Torso angle ‚â§ 40¬∞ |
| Sitting | Knees bent < 145¬∞ |
| Lying | Torso angle ‚â• 55¬∞ |

Pose detection triggers alerts at **10s, 25s, 40s**.  
Vehicle detection extracts **color**, **type**, and **best frame** based on quality score.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|--------|-----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | pip install -r requirements.txt |
| dlib fails | Install CMake or Build Tools (Windows) |
| CUDA not detected | pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 |
| Telegram not working | Verify Token + Chat ID, message bot first |
| Email not sending | Use 16-char App Password |
| Slow performance | Reduce frame size or increase skip rate |
